# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis – Tableau Dashboard

## 📌 Executive Summary  
This project focuses on analyzing **customer churn** using Tableau to uncover insights into customer behavior, revenue trends, and churn patterns. By leveraging data from CSV files, interactive dashboards were created to provide a deeper understanding of revenue fluctuations, customer lifecycle, and churn dynamics. The analysis helps stakeholders make informed decisions to improve retention, optimize revenue, and implement effective churn-reduction strategies.

## ❓ Business Problem  
Customer churn significantly impacts revenue growth and profitability. High churn rates indicate customer dissatisfaction, lack of engagement, or ineffective retention strategies. Businesses need to:  
- Identify **when and why customers churn**.  
- Understand the balance between **new vs recurring customers**.  
- Detect **geographical trends** in revenue contribution.  
- Track **resurrections** (customers who re-subscribe after churn).  
- Measure the **long-term behavior of customer cohorts**.  

Without these insights, businesses risk losing valuable customers and revenue opportunities.
